// Note from Piotr
// There are many ways how ExpandedNodeId could be conceived --
// In the style of open62541-compat it simply should be a wrapper on top of UA_ExpandedNodeId,
// But it's difficult to judge how that would affect API etc. So now we have sth simple that conforms for UA-SDK API,
// And then "we will see" if to remap the implementation.
